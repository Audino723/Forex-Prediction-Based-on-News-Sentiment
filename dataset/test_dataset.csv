1,"Oct 24, 2023 7:30 AM +07:00",Euro Jumps on Treasury Yield Slide and a Technical Break.,"The Euro has managed to rally to start this week after a volatile trading session through the US time zone.

Most notably, Treasury yields climbed higher overnight before retreating lower after famed investors, Bill Ackman and Bill Gross Tweeted some bullish dynamics for US government debt.

Ackman said that his organisation had covered its short bond position due to concerns about the outlook for the US economy.

Not long after, Bill Gross, a fixed-income specialist, made public his preference for buying the Treasury inverted yield curve in the 2s 10s and 2s 5s.

He is expressing a view of buying the short-end bonds and selling the long-end bonds on the basis that the Federal Reserve mantra of ‘higher for longer is yesterday’s news’.

He also sees problems ahead for the US economy and is buying near-term interest rate futures outright that will settle in 2025.

The context for EUR/USD is the possibility that Treasury yields might have peaked, particularly for the benchmark 10-year note. Time will tell if the ‘Bills’ are correct or otherwise.
EUR/USD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS UPDATE
EUR/USD cleanly broke through the topside of a descending trend channel last Thursday and continued higher before pausing at minor resistance levels near 1.0680 today. To learn more about breakout trading, click on the banner below.

The next resistance levels could be at the breakpoints and previous highs near 1.0740, 1.0770, 1.0835 and 1.0945 ahead of a cluster zone of potential resistance in the 1.1075 – 1.1100 area.

The 100- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) are both near 1.0825 and may offer resistance.

On the downside, nearby support might lie near the breakpoint at 1.0617 which also has the 34-day SMA just below, potentially lending support.

Further down, a series of breakpoints and prior lows in the 1.0480 – 1.0495 area might provide a support zone. Below there, the lows of early 2023, which were tested at the start of this month, may provide support near 1.0440 levels of note.",Negative
2,"Oct 20, 2023 11:00 AM +07:00",USD/JPY Weekly Forecast: Japanese Yen Staggers Towards 150,"The Japanese Yen is yet again at the border of the significant 150 level after comments from Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Ueda made several cautious statements (see below) but one in particular stood out on monetary policy. He reiterated the continued implementation of accommodative monetary policy to reach their inflation goals after Japanese inflation softened on all metrics including both core and headline prints. This weighed negatively on the yen and against a backdrop where the US dollar is marginally on offer.

“Uncertainty surrounding Japan's economy is very high.”

“The BoJ will aim at stably and sustainably achieving the 2% inflation target, accompanied by wage growth, by patiently maintaining the current easy policy.”

“We must carefully watch financial and FX market moves, along with their impact on Japan's economy and prices.”

That being said, energy prices have been on the rise and could have an upside influence on inflation going forward. Money markets currently forecast an interest rate hike around July/September 2024 and with wages showing marked increases, there may be a less dovish outlook to come from the BoJ should these data points continue their current trajectory.
Looking at the 10-year JGB below, the yield is steadily approaching the 1% cap as per the yield curve control guidelines. The BoJ will be keeping a close eye on this metric to avoid any rapid rally higher.With rising tensions in between Israel-Hamas, the safe haven allure of the yen has been temporarily overshadowed by the aforementioned dovish remarks but intervention around these levels could be on the cards.

The week ahead will be focused mostly on US specific factors but the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation (PCE price index) will carry the most significance. Other key data includes durable goods orders, Michigan consumer sentiment and GDP.
Daily USD/JPY price action resembles an ascending triangle formation with resistance at the 150.00 psychological handle. Traditionally, a bullish signal but with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) exhibiting lower highs, bearish/negative divergence could suggest a possible pullback lower.

Treasury yields remain robust after a small pullback as Fed policy moves into view
If USD/JPY trades well above 150, volatility could accelerate
√=The Japanese Yen is flirting around recent lows with USD/JPY poking above 150 in early Asian trade but unable to overcome the 150.16 high seen earlier this month.

The 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) is near 0.86%, the highest since 2013. The Nikkei news service is reporting that the Bank of Japan is considering tweaking its yield curve control program (YCC).

This follows on from speculation last week that the bank is considering raising its policy rate from below -0.10%.

If USD/JPY makes a clean break above 150 the 33-year high of 151.95 might move into view.

Such a move may also see physical intervention from the BoJ in currency markets. Historically, central bank intervention tends to be most effective when done in combination with supportive fundamental factors.

This places the importance of any BoJ adjustments to the policy rate or YCC at the front of the market’s mind.

Elsewhere, Treasury yields have ticked up to start the week after easing into the weekend with the Federal Reserve now in a blackout period ahead of its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starting October 31st.

The benchmark 10-year note traded at its highest level since 2007, nudging over 5.0% on Friday and remains near there going into Monday’s session.

Before the cone of silence was lowered, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester added to the growing chorus of board members hinting toward a peak in the policy rate when she said, “We are likely near or at a holding point on the funds rate.”

APAC equity indices have followed the Wall Street lead from Friday with all the major markets bathed in a sea of red. India’s stock exchanges have faired a bit better, trading almost flat for the day.

Spot gold has eased to start the week after failing to clear US$ 2,000 on Friday. Crude oil has also given up some of its recent gains as energy markets ponder the geopolitical backdrop in the Middle East.

With inflation falling, but not at a fast enough rate for the Fed, Chair Powell will likely reiterate that the Fed remains steadfast in its fight against inflation.

GBPUSD FUNDAMENTAL BACKDROP
Sticky UK CPI earlier this week was not enough to maintain the pound’s turnaround as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East remains the dominant theme at present. Diplomatic efforts to address the conflict have since been diminished after a hospital explosion, stoking pressures within the region between Israel and Hamas. The safe haven US dollar will draw greater attention in this environment but the address by Fed Chair Jerome Powell later today (see economic calendar below) will be the focus for cable.
With the aforementioned uncertainty taking place, mixed US economic data including better than expected retail sales and a large uptick in US Treasury yields could see Jerome Powell adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach before making any definitive moves. The November meeting is likely to result in no interest rate hike from the Fed and I do not foresee a shift towards something more hawkish. The Fed will look to gather more economic data and with the blackout period of Fed communication around the corner, the Fed Chair’s speech will be closely monitored ahead of the rate announcement in early November. With no economic data scheduled from a UK perspective, US specific factors will be the driving force for GBP/USD. Price action on the daily cable chart above sees the death cross (blue) coinciding with pound weakness as the pair breaks below bear flag (black) support. Today’s candle close will be crucial as a close below support could spark a move lower towards the 1.2200 psychological level and beyond.

GBPUSD FUNDAMENTAL BACKDROP
UK CPI data (see economic calendar below) showed a continued decline in both headline and core inflation respectively despite actual figures marginally beating forecasts. Overall the report is largely in line with expectations but shows some resilience of inflationary pressures within the UK economy. Higher crude oil prices saw motor fuel being the largest upward contributor to the change in annual rates, while moderating pressures arose from food and non-alcoholic beverages and furniture and household goods (Source: ONS).

A decline in PPI is promising and being a leading indicator for CPI, could see future CPI figures fall as well. The BoE will look at this closely ahead of the November meeting.

GBP/USD ECONOMIC CALENDAR (GMT +02:00) The British pound found some support post-announcement against the US dollar but little change was seen in money market pricing expectations (refer to table below). Bank of England (BoE) rate projections remain in favor of a pause in the November meeting and with global central banks likely adopting the same standpoint due to escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, incoming data will be closely monitored to gauge the BoE’s next steps – jobs data due on October 24 next week. Price action on the daily cable chart shows the pair trading within a bear flag formation (black) around the 1.2200 psychological level. Bears will be hopeful that the addition of a death cross (blue) could spark a break below flag support and push the pair lower towards subsequent support zones.

The US Dollar has slipped through the Asian session after making some headway overnight on the back of Treasury yields pushing toward multi-year peaks.

US retail sales rose by 0.7% month-on-month in September, higher than the 0.3% anticipated and slightly better than the burgeoning 0.6% for August.

Treasury yields leapt higher across the curve with the 5- and 7-year bonds seeing the largest gains, adding around 15 basis points each.

The monetary policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury note traded at 5.24% overnight for the first time since 2006 while the benchmark 10-year note traded within a whisker of the 4.88% seen earlier this month, the highest since 2007.

Despite the run-up in yields, spot gold rallied to a 1-month peak above US$ 1,940 as the fallout from the rocket attack on a Palestinian hospital continues with both sides blaming each other.

The meeting between US President Joe Biden and Arab leaders has been put on ice and crude oil added over 2% as it eyes the highs seen last week.

The WTI futures contract traded up to US$ 88.80 bbl while the Brent contract touched US$ 92.18 bbl. Both contracts have eased going into the European session.

AUD/USD has been a notable mover in the last few sessions after yesterday’s hawkish RBA meeting minutes were backed up by RBA Governor Michele Bullock’s comments at a summit today. Interest rate markets now have a 25 basis point hike priced in by the end of 3Q 2024.

China’s GDP also assisted the Aussie Dollar after it came in at 1.3% quarter-on-quarter for 3Q, above the 0.9% forecast and 0.8% prior.

Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke at the Belt and Road forum in Beijing and talked up the initiative, adding that restrictions on foreign investment for manufacturing will be eased.

Meanwhile, China’s property sector continues to provide an anxious backdrop for investors with Country Garden bond holders yet to receive their latest coupon payments so far today.

APAC equities have had a mostly lacklustre day following on from Wall Street’s lead although China’s CSI 300 index has traded over 0.5% lower despite the upbeat GDP figures there. EUR/USD steadied again today after it nudged higher overnight, testing the upper band of a descending trend channel.

The budget has been approved after calls from major European Central Bank representatives, Vasle and Nagel for 'fiscal discipline' in order to contain widening spreads. In order to get inflation back to target monetary policy and fiscal policy need to work in unison. Increased government spending always runs the risk of elevating general price pressures, something the ECB is looking to avoid as it holds rates at a record 4% ahead of next week's ECB rate setting meeting.

BUNDESBANK HINTS THAT GERMAN ECONOMY LIKELY SHRUNK IN Q3
Germany’s Bundesbank produced a monthly report pointing towards the likelihood of another quarterly contraction as industrial production and weakening consumption plagues Europe’s largest economy.

The report comes ahead of flash German and EU PMI data for October, which is expected to show very little progress, remaining at suppressed levels. The German manufacturing PMI data set – a sector that normally produces strong results - has led the rest of Europe lower.

Should a contraction be confirmed, it would result in fourth straight non-positive quarter. Negative GDP growth during Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 placed Germany into a technical recession, followed by a flat GDP growth in Q2.

In addition, US Treasury yields maintain elevated despite easing in recent sessions. This is in contrast with the EU where fundamental data continues to suffer. Nevertheless, EUR/USD appears to be experiencing a reprieve.

Sliding US Treasury bond yields undermine the US dollar.

The German economy remained in contraction territory for the fourth month in a row, according to the latest S&P HCOB flash PMIs. The composite index fell to 45.9 from 46.4 in September, while business activity fell from 50.3 to 48.0.

Business activity in France, the Eurozone’s second-largest economy, picked up marginally from September but remained in contraction territory. With the manufacturing sector falling deeper into contraction territory, indicators point to fractional growth at best in the fourth quarter, according to data provider S&P HCOB.

Overall, the Euro Area economic downturn accelerated at the start of the fourth quarter with the composite index falling to a 35-month low of 46.5 compared to 47.2 in September.

Commenting on the flash PMI data, Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: “In the Eurozone, things are moving from bad to worse. Manufacturing has been in a slump for sixteen months, services for three, and both PMI headline indices just took another hit. In addition, all subindices point very consistently downwards, too, with only a few exceptions. Overall, this points to another lacklustre quarter. We wouldn’t be caught off guard to see a mild recession in the Eurozone in the second half of this year with two back-to-back quarters of negative growth.’ While the Euro edged marginally lower post-PMI data, yesterday’s sell-off in US Treasury yields has helped to underpin EUR/USD.
